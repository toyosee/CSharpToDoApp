    Mark as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed, adding a completion date and time.
    Print Tasks: Users have the option to print the list of tasks directly from the application.

    Run: Double-click on ToDoApp.exe to launch the application.
    Interface: Use the graphical interface to add, remove, mark tasks as completed, and print the task list.

Note:

    Ensure that the "tasks.txt" file is in the same directory as ToDoApp.exe to save and load tasks correctly.
